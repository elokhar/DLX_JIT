# DLX_JIT
A simple Just-In-Time compiler, which converts DLX code to x64 machine code. Project developed during Advanced Computer Architectures university course using a template provided by the teacher. Project contains code file implementing a FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter (soi.cod), and input and output files (in.dat, out.dat). After running the program, it compiles the DLX code and them executes it using input from in.dat and writes output to out.dat. 

Arguments: DLX code file (.cod), input file (.dat), output file (.dat).
